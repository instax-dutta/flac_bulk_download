## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Export Your Spotify Playlist

**🎯 Recommended: Use [Exportify](https://exportify.net/)**

[Exportify](https://exportify.net/) is the easiest and most reliable way to export your Spotify playlists:

1. **Visit [Exportify.net](https://exportify.net/)**
2. **Log in with your Spotify account** (secure OAuth authentication)
3. **Select your playlist** from the dropdown menu
4. **Click "Export"** to download the CSV file
5. **Save the file** as `playlist.csv` in this directory

**Alternative methods:**
- [Spotify Playlist Exporter](https://spotify-playlist-exporter.herokuapp.com/)
- Manual export from Spotify Web Player

### Step 2: Extract Track List

```bash
python3 extract_tracks_from_csv.py
```

This will:
- Read your `playlist.csv` file
- Extract track names and artists
- Create `track_list.txt` with format: "Song Title - Artist Name"
- Remove duplicates automatically

### Step 3: Download FLAC Tracks

```bash
python3 download_flac_tracks.py
```

This will:
- Process all tracks from `track_list.txt`
- Download each track in FLAC lossless quality
- Save files to `downloads/` directory
- Remove successfully downloaded tracks from the list
- Log failed downloads to `track_list_failed.txt`

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No tracks found in track_list.txt"**
   - Make sure you've run `extract_tracks_from_csv.py` first
   - Check that your CSV file is named `playlist.csv`

2. **"Track not available on Tidal"**
   - Some tracks may not be available on Tidal
   - Check `track_list_failed.txt` for details

3. **Download timeouts**
   - Increase `TIMEOUT_PER_TRACK` in the script
   - Check your internet connection

4. **API rate limiting**
   - The script includes delays between requests
   - If issues persist, increase the delay in the script

### Getting Help

- Check the `track_list_failed.txt` file for specific error messages
- Ensure your CSV file has the correct format
- Verify your internet connection
